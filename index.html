<h2>What is Tajweed and Why is it Important?</h2>
<h2>Understanding Tajweed</h2>
<p>Tajweed is a set of rules that govern the correct pronunciation and phonetics of Quranic Arabic. It ensures that every letter is given its due rights in recitation, preserving the original beauty and meaning of the Quran. Without Tajweed, the recitation might lose clarity or, worse, change meanings.</p>
<h2>Importance of Tajweed</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Preserves the Quran&rsquo;s intended meanings accurately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhances the beauty and spirituality of recitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honors the traditional way the Quran was revealed and taught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Builds confidence in reciting aloud in prayers and gatherings.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This rule teaches when to merge certain letters for smoother recitation.</p>

<p>The echoing sound on certain letters when they are pronounced with a sukoon (pause).</p>
